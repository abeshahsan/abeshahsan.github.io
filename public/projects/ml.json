    "description": "Advanced research in weakly supervised semantic segmentation leveraging transformer architectures for enhanced object detail recognition. Replaced conventional CLIP/ViT encoders with UniCL's Swin Transformer to enable superior local feature extraction through hierarchical windowed attention. Developed novel CAM generation and refinement pipeline, optimizing affinity calculations and exploiting intermediate encoder features. Achieved 50% mean IoU with significantly improved fine-grained mask quality, demonstrating state-of-the-art detail preservation across diverse object classes.",
